## Usage of Composer packages

- This project includes the growth-tools package `https://github.com/caseproof/growth-tools` . This package is required in other products (EA, TA, PL..) so its namespace is prefixed with `WishListMember` to avoid dependency collision. More details can be found in the growth-tools repo. The prefixing task is done via Strauss library `https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/strauss`
- When `growth-tools` repo is updated, we have to update its contents here by `composer update`
- `vendor-prefixed` is generated by Strauss. After running `composer update` we have to run `composer strauss` to update this `vendor-prefixed` folder
